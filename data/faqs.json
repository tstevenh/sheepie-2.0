          "question": "Are they reusable? How do I clean them?",
          "answer": "Yes, CalmiCloud is designed for repeated use. Simply wash gently with mild soap and warm water, let them air-dry completely, and store in the provided clean case. With proper care, they outlast disposable foam plugs significantly."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do they come in different sizes?",
          "answer": "CalmiCloud features a universal moldable design. Instead of forcing a specific size into your ear canal, you shape the silicone to seal your outer ear, providing a custom, pressure-free fit for any ear size."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will I still hear my alarm clock?",
          "answer": "Yes. CalmiCloud is engineered to reduce background noise (like snoring or traffic) by approximately 28dB. Important alert sounds, such as alarms or phone ringtones, remain audible for your safety."

        {
          "question": "Does it press on my eyelashes or eyelids?",
          "answer": "Not at all. The mask features deep 3D contoured eye cavities that allow you to blink freely. It provides total blackout isolation without any pressure on your eyes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the strap hair-friendly?",
          "answer": "Yes. We use a smooth, snag-free adjustable strap designed specifically to prevent tangling, unlike the rough elastic bands found on standard masks."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it machine washable?",
          "answer": "We recommend hand washing to maximize the lifespan of the memory foam. If you must use a machine, place the mask in a laundry bag and use a delicate cycle with cold water."

        {
          "question": "Is the pillow hard or soft?",
          "answer": "CerviCloud utilizes medium-firm memory foam. It is engineered to be supportive enough to hold your cervical spine in neutral alignment, yet compliant enough to feel comfortable, never stiff."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there an adjustment period?",
          "answer": "Yes, typically 7-14 nights. If you are switching from a traditional pillow, your neck muscles and spine may need time to relax into their correct natural alignment."

        {
          "question": "Is the cover washable?",
          "answer": "Yes. The cooling bamboo outer cover is removable and machine washable. Please do not wash the inner memory foam core."
