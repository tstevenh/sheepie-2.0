  "FAQs": {
    "calmi": {
      "reusable": { "q": "Are they reusable? How do I clean them?", "a": "Yes, CalmiCloud is designed for repeated use. Simply wash gently with mild soap and warm water, let them air-dry completely, and store in the provided clean case. With proper care, they outlast disposable foam plugs significantly." },
      "sizes": { "q": "Do they come in different sizes?", "a": "CalmiCloud features a universal moldable design. Instead of forcing a specific size into your ear canal, you shape the silicone to seal your outer ear, providing a custom, pressure-free fit for any ear size." },
      "alarm": { "q": "Will I still hear my alarm clock?", "a": "Yes. CalmiCloud is engineered to reduce background noise (like snoring or traffic) by approximately 28dB. Important alert sounds, such as alarms or phone ringtones, remain audible for your safety." }
    },
    "lumi": {
      "eyelashes": { "q": "Does it press on my eyelashes or eyelids?", "a": "Not at all. The mask features deep 3D contoured eye cavities that allow you to blink freely. It provides total blackout isolation without any pressure on your eyes." },
      "strap": { "q": "Is the strap hair-friendly?", "a": "Yes. We use a smooth, snag-free adjustable strap designed specifically to prevent tangling, unlike the rough elastic bands found on standard masks." },
      "washable": { "q": "Is it machine washable?", "a": "We recommend hand washing to maximize the lifespan of the memory foam. If you must use a machine, place the mask in a laundry bag and use a delicate cycle with cold water." }
    },
    "cervi": {
      "firmness": { "q": "Is the pillow hard or soft?", "a": "CerviCloud utilizes medium-firm memory foam. It is engineered to be supportive enough to hold your cervical spine in neutral alignment, yet compliant enough to feel comfortable, never stiff." },
      "adjustment": { "q": "Is there an adjustment period?", "a": "Yes, typically 7-14 nights. If you are switching from a traditional pillow, your neck muscles and spine may need time to relax into their correct natural alignment." },
      "cover": { "q": "Is the cover washable?", "a": "Yes. The cooling bamboo outer cover is removable and machine washable. Please do not wash the inner memory foam core." }
    },
    "shipping": {
      "returns": { "q": "What is your return policy?", "a": "We accept returns or exchanges for manufacturing defects or incorrect items received. Due to strict hygiene standards, we cannot accept returns on used sleep products unless they are defective." },
      "duration": { "q": "How long does shipping take?", "a": "Orders are typically processed within 24 hours. Standard delivery takes 2–5 working days, depending on your location." }
